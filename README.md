- 👋 Hi, I'm David Ubuara
- 👀 I’m very interested in Geology, Geophysics, Data Science and Machine Learning, 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning different machine learning algorithms
- 🥰 I played a pivotal role in our efforts to advance the field of petrophysics and geology, specifically in the context of the Niger Delta. My contribution to our team's work were nothing short of remarkable. Notably, I spearheaded the development of cutting-edge machine learning solutions for petrophysical analysis derived from core data and utilized neural networks to create sophisticated algorithms that have significantly enhanced our understanding of the region's geological characteristics.
- 🤩 One of my most noteworthy accomplishments was the application of unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify raw data into distinct categories. These data classes were then utilized to train neural networks, which in turn generated invaluable petrophysical solutions. These solutions are currently actively utilized in companies' ongoing drilling campaigns, demonstrating my tangible impact in the industry. What sets me apart was my remarkable work ethic and self-driven nature. I required minimal supervision and consistently delivers exceptional results. My ability to engage in high-level discussions and convert them into innovative solutions was truly commendable. Additionally, I possess excellent communication skills, both in writing and presentation. My articulate and compelling presentations have been instrumental in conveying complex technical concepts to a wider audience.
- 🥳 I love working with different technologies & platforms and my current favorite ones are

❤️ Python
❤️ Jupyter
❤️ Colab AI
❤️ TensorFlow
❤️ Sci-kit learn
❤️ R
